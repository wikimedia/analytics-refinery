This directory contains the weekly job computing wikidata item-page links
from a wikidata_entity snapshot, a mediawiki-page-history snapshot and
a project-namespace-map snapshot.

The link-information is encoded as wikidata-entity sitelink values. Those
values are URLs to the pages the entity is the equal concept, on every wiki
(for instance the entity Q3044 'Charlemagne' has sitelinks like
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne and
https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86).
Also, sitelinks to pages in non-main namespaces have the namespace localized
in the language project, adding some complexity retrieving the related page.

Note: page-history being computed monthly and wikidata-entity weekly,
item_page_link gets less precise as they the month advance (the first snapshot
of the month is more up-to-date than the last, due to pages data being almost
one month old). To try and address this, as of 2020-05-20 we're joining to
mediawiki_page_move event data to get the more recent titles.
