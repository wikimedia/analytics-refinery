* Article Recommender
  Generate recommendations for Wikipedia article creation

** Requirements
   - A virtual environment zip that contains [[https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/admin/projects/research/article-recommender][article-recommender]]. See
     [[https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/admin/projects/research/article-recommender/deploy][the documentation]] on how to generate the zip file.
   - Once the zip is generated, save it to ~/.

** How to update the dependency
   - Generate a new zip file by following instructions above.
   - Upload the zip file to Archiva using the instructions at [fn:1].
     Here are the values I used for uploading version 0.0.1:
     + Repository Id :: Wikimedia Mirrored Repository
     + Group ID :: article-recommender
     + Artifact ID :: venv
     + Version :: 0.0.1
     + Packaging :: zip
   - Download the zip file from Archiva to the following location (save
     it as venv-X.X.X.zip (where X.X.X is the version number):
     `../../artifacts/article-recommender/

[fn:1] https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Archiva#Uploading_dependency_artifacts

** How to train more languages
   - Update ./language-pairs.txt and add source and target languages.

** How to update topsites
   - This should ideally be done automatically, but for now you can
     update the ./topsites.tsv file.
