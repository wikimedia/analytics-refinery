<!--
Defines reusable datasets for event data.
Use this dataset in your coordinator.xml files by setting:

    ${event_data_directory}     - Path to event data.
                                  Example: /wmf/data/event
    start time is hard coded!   - We need to start when data is available,
                                  and can't rely on the coordinator start_time
                                  because in some cases we need data before

NOTE: special for events datasets, we use datacenter=eqiad as a proxy for
"availability" of the data.  This may be empty if we have switched to codfw,
but that's ok for now since it doesn't happen that often.  If the job is stuck
waiting for an empty folder, we'll get an SLA alarm and intervene manually.

Consumers have to take care to query the hive table with the same hours and
not specify the datacenter partition.  This will get all available data.
