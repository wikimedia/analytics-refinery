# Configures a coordinator to manage aggregating
# 24 hours of actor features into the rollup table
# Any of the following properties are overidable with -D.
# Usage:
# sudo -u analytics oozie job --oozie $OOZIE_URL \
#   -Dstart_time='2019-05-08T17:00Z' \
#   -config oozie/learning/features/actor/rollup/hourly/coordinator.properties \
#   -run
#
# NOTE:  The $oozie_directory must be synced to HDFS so that all relevant
#        .xml files exist there when this job is submitted.
