# Configures a coordinator to reindex a month of banner activity data
# for better compaction. Original loading is done daily on small data,
# this job reads a month of already indexed data and reindexes it,
# making it more compact and therefore more efficient for computation.
# It also removes all sensitive fields from the data set so that it
# can be kept for more than 90 days. Note that this job is launched
# with 3 months delay, so that data is sanitized only after 90 days.
#
# Any of the following properties are override-able with -D.
# Usage:
# sudo -u analytics oozie job --oozie $OOZIE_URL \
#   -Dstart_time='2019-01-01T00:00Z' \
#   -config oozie/banner_activity/druid/monthly/coordinator.properties \
#   -run
#
# NOTE:  The $refinery_directory must be synced to HDFS so that all relevant
#        .xml files exist there when this job is submitted.
